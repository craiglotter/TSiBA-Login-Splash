TSiBA-Login-Splash
==================

Commerce I.T. moved to sponsor.install a computer lab for the TSiBA Education School situated in Cape Town. This program is launched on system login and appears as a screen-grabbing splash screen displaying a editable text message on which the student can either accept or reject logging in to the computer. If the student rejects the terms of entry, the computer will automatically logout.  Created by Craig Lotter, January 2006
