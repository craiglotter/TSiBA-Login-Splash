TSiBA Login Splash
==================

Commerce I.T. moved to sponsor.install a computer lab for the TSiBA Education School situated in Cape Town. This program is launched on system login and appears as a screen-grabbing splash screen displaying a editable text message on which the student can either accept or reject logging in to the computer. If the student rejects the terms of entry, the computer will automatically logout.
